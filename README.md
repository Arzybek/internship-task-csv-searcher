## Test task for an internship in the company
I did it back in the 2021. It's not a recent project. Just posting a public anonymized version of it. \
**Task:**  There's a CSV file with data about airports. \
**Needed:** Create a console application that will take a column number from apps parameters, wait for users search input and display found results (searching in that column by input), count of found results and time in ms that search took. \
**Criterias:** The search must be fast and don't depend on the number of rows, not take too much ram and don't break on the bad examples \
**Example run:** java -jar test-task-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 2 \
Column â„–2 \
Your input: Bo \
... \
Found rows: 68 \
Time spent: 7ms
